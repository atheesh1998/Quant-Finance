# Quant-Finance
A repo to implement and experiment with various concepts within quantitative finance.


## Contents:

* Performance Computing: A comparison of speeds in the implementation of functions on a large array of numbers between the generic, numpy, numexpr, and the numexpr (with processing from all available threads). This is critical since, in financial analytics, the processing speed can spell the difference between soaring profits and crippling losses.

* Monte Carlo Simulation: Monte Carlo simulations are used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables. It is a technique used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty in prediction and forecasting models.

* Efficient Frontier: Optimal portfolio allocation of a bucket of 5 Indian Mid Cap and Large Cap Equities based on the Efficient Frontier concept.
