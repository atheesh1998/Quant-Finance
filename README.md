# Quant-Finance
A repository intended to implement and experiment with various concepts within quantitative finance, including but not limited to, Interest Rate Modeling, Stochastic Processes, Time Series Analysis, Asset Allocation, Statistical Arbitrage and Derivatives Pricing. 

For educational purposes only. Mainly to get acclimated with the field of computational finance.

## Contents:

Basic implementations of the following. Adapted from various sources.

* Monte Carlo Simulation: Monte Carlo simulations are used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables. It is a technique used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty in prediction and forecasting models.

* Efficient Frontier: Optimal portfolio allocation of a bucket of 5 Indian Mid Cap and Large Cap Equities based on the Efficient Frontier concept. Best allocation percentages were derived for maximum Sharpe Ratio and minimum Standard Deviation portfolios.

* A basic implementation of Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedastic modelling.

* Common models for Interest Rate Modeling
